# lab 11 :sunny:

`ClinentDemo.java` and `ServerSemo.java` is the sample code to create a socket

`GradeQueryClient.java` and `GradeQueryServer.java` is the exercise code

Do not forget to add the library dependency `sqlite-jdbc-3.34.0.jar`

If you want to run my code, please add one more dependency `commons-csv-1.8.jar` which provides really convenient `csv` reader and writer. 

This `jar` has also been used in Assignment 2.



There are no more labs as **10** labs will get full marks.
